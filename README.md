# Notepad

## Description

This app is designed to help keep track of notes taken throughout the day right on your browser! Working on this project allowed me to gain experience with routing through Express as well as figuring out how to start building an app's back end.

## Usage 

Click <a href="https://c11-notepad-4aaa5a95b96c.herokuapp.com/">this link</a> in your favorite browser to open the app!<br>
On the left hand side of the page you can see previously saved notes. Clicking on a saved note will display it's contents on the right hand side of the page. To create a new note simply press the plus sign at the top right hand corner of the blue nav bar and enter your note's title and note below!
